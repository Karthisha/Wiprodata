📌 TDD Todo Application - Project Report
🔹 Project Overview
This project is a Todo Application built with React using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.
The goal was to practice writing tests first, implementing features iteratively, and ensuring that all functionalities are well-tested before deployment.
The application allows users to:
•	Add new tasks
•	Mark tasks as completed
•	Delete tasks
•	Persist tasks in local storage
The project is deployed and accessible at:
🌐 Live Demo: https://startling-biscuit-ebad34.netlify.app/

🔹 Testing Approach
We followed the TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodology:
1.	Write a failing test for the feature.
2.	Implement the minimum code required to make the test pass.
3.	Refactor the code while keeping tests green.
Tools & Libraries
•	Jest → Unit Testing
•	React Testing Library → Component Testing
Test Cases Implemented
✔ Render the Todo component
✔ Add a new todo item
✔ Mark a todo as completed
✔ Delete a todo
✔ Persist todos in localStorage
Run tests with:
npm test

🔹 Components Created
•	App.js → Root component
•	TodoList.js → Displays all tasks
•	TodoItem.js → Individual task with complete/delete actions
•	AddTodo.js → Input field and button to add a new task
